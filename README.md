# Notification-bot
A simple Telegram bot that sends reminders in the form of messages, which helps you remember things. You can record important meetings or similar things so you don't miss them. To run it, you need to add TOKEN='your_telegrambot_token' to the environment variables.
Next, run it with python main.py .
That's all you need!

// I'll add a database and some other features soon.
